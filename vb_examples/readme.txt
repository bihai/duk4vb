note that full_ocx and jsThing are still in development.

you will probably have to compile any exes in these two directories
yourself to ensure they are using the latest ocx version
(binary compatiability not yet set)

the ocx uses a different scivb control:

https://github.com/dzzie/scivb2

Im not sure if I want to compile this one directly into the dukdbg ocx
yet or not. (Adds allot of complexity to an already complex code
base). 

I used a fresh build of scivb because I wanted to break compatability and 
add a couple more things to its base build. Eventually this will be
the base going forward, but I am not going to set binary compatabilty
on it to soon and give myself time to flesh out how i want.
