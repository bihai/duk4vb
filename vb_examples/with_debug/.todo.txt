eval
putvar?
use getlocals or not? (seems only valid within a function body..and we have mouseover var lookup so optional)
listbreak - we manage our own list (with compact on delete)

test debugger with multiple files and calling to a external function..
  99% of the time initial addfile calls will only be libraries i want to hide from user
  so i dont want to ever pause execution in side of them (what about an exception though?)
  same way as msscript control just show an error message..
  i also dont want complexity of having to show multiple files in UI switching, saving
  etc..
