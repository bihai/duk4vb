this project hopes to create a vb6 usable build of the duktape js engine 
along with an integrate IDE and debugger for it.

another goal is to have it mimic the MS script control support of 
arbitrary COM objects for vb6 host integration.

currently in the early stages and experimental but functioning so far.

no major roadblocks hit yet.
